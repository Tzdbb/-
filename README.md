The overall architecture of the proposed DUST framework, which consists of: 1) Discretization of CIR signals, where a composite kernel adaptively determines quantization intervals to denoise and discretize the CIR amplitude sequence, followed by exponential nonlinear mapping to obtain a discrete index unit sequence; 2) Dual-domain feature fusion which integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features extracted from the discrete sequence to capture both local and global signal characteristics; and 3) Hybrid Transformer and SVM, where Transformer encoders abstract the fused features and an SVM classifier produces the final NLOS/LOS identification results.
