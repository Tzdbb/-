# -# DUST: Discrete Unit Sequence Transformer for Ultra-Wideband Non-Line-of-Sight Identification


The overall architecture of the proposed DUST framework, which consists of: \textbf{1) Discretization of CIR signals}, where a composite kernel adaptively determines quantization intervals to denoise and discretize the CIR amplitude sequence, followed by exponential nonlinear mapping to obtain a discrete index unit sequence; \textbf{2) Dual-domain feature fusion}, which integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features extracted from the discrete sequence to capture both local and global signal characteristics; and \textbf{3) Hybrid Transformer and SVM}, where Transformer encoders abstract the fused features and an SVM classifier produces the final NLOS/LOS identification result.
